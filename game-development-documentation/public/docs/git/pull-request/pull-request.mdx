# Pull Request
**A pull request (PR)** --> Developer's proposed changes to a codebase
## Basic Flow
1. **Create a branch** - Make changes in separate branch
2. **Submit a PR** - Ask to "pull" changes to main branch
3. **Review** - Other devs review code
4. **Merge** - If approved, changes get added into codebase

### Why isn't called a Merge Request?
**Pull Request (GitHub's term)**: Requester's perspective - asking the maintainer to "pull" your changes from your branch into theirs.

**Merge Request (GitLab's term)**: What actually happens - your changes get "merged" into the main branch.

## Creating a Pull Request

### Using Command Line
1. Ensure that your branch is pushed

4. Example next steps:
