# Transition Between Scenes

## `get_tree()` Function

`get_tree()` in Godot is a method that returns a reference to the current **SceneTree** object, which is the main loop and scene management system in Godot.

The **SceneTree** is the core that handles:
- Scene management - Loading, changing, and managing scenes
- Main game loop - Processing frames, physics, and rendering
- Node tree operations - Managing the hierarchy of nodes
- Global game state - Pausing, quitting, notifications
